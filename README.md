Step 1: Define Microservices Architecture
Services:

User Service: Handles user registration, authentication, and user data management.
Product Service: Manages product inventory, including CRUD operations.
Order Service: Handles order creation, updates, and queries.
Technology Stack:

Spring Boot: For creating microservices due to its ease of use and comprehensive ecosystem.
Eureka Server: For service discovery in a dynamic environment.
Spring Cloud Gateway: For routing and API gateway.
Spring Security: For securing microservices.
RabbitMQ: For asynchronous communication between services.
PostgreSQL: As the relational database for storing structured data.
MongoDB: (Optional) For storing logs or session information.
Docker & Kubernetes: For containerization and orchestration to achieve high availability.
Step 2: Implement Concurrency Control in Product Service
To manage concurrent access, use optimistic locking. In Spring Data JPA, you can simply add a version field to your entity.
When an update operation is performed, Spring Data JPA will automatically check the version. If another transaction has updated the record in the meantime, a OptimisticLockingFailureException is thrown.

Step 3: Set Up Clustering and High Availability
Dockerize your microservices using Dockerfile and define your service architecture using docker-compose.yml or Kubernetes configuration files (deployment.yml, service.yml).

Kubernetes:

Use Deployments for managing stateless apps.
Use StatefulSets for databases if needed.
Use Services for stable network addresses.
Configure Liveness and Readiness Probes for health checks.
Set up Horizontal Pod Autoscaler for dynamic scaling.
Step 4: Database Integration and Schema Design
For PostgreSQL, create tables for users, products, and orders. Use Spring Data JPA repositories to interact with these tables.
Step 5: Develop APIs and Communication
Define RESTful APIs using Spring Web. For synchronous calls, use RestTemplate or WebClient. For asynchronous communication, publish and consume messages using RabbitMQ.
Step 6: Implement Authentication and Authorization
Use Spring Security and JWT for securing your microservices. Implement a filter to validate JWT tokens in requests to protected endpoints.
Step 7: Error Handling, Logging, Testing, and Deployment
Implement global error handling using @ControllerAdvice in Spring.
Use SLF4J with Logback for logging.
Write unit tests for services, repositories, and controllers. Use @MockBean to mock dependencies.
Create Dockerfiles for each service and a docker-compose.yml or Kubernetes manifests for deployment.
